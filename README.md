# Project: Angle Discrimination Behavior Analysis

Scripts primarily used to analyze behavioral choice in object angle discrimination of mice. 

Primary question: what are the neural correlates of object angle representaition in mouse vS1? So, why look at behavior? 
Whisker dependent features and choice parameters made my rodents will inform and reduce the search space of what whisker dependent features will drive object angle representation.
Questions targeted to behavioral choice:
1) What whisker dependent touch features best discriminate coarse (45 vs 135) and fine (45:15:135) angles? 
2) Which whisker dependent touch features are most important in driving angle perception? 

main_builder: primary script used to package trial by trial whisker motion into design matrices and answer the above 2 questions
main_figure_builder: script used to compile main and supplemental figures for publication. 
master_figure_builder: script for detailed adhoc plots and analysis.
